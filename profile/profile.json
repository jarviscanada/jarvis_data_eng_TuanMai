        "Undergraduate Thesis: Designed and developed a HoloLens augmented reality application (C#) that allows medical professionals to better plan surgical procedures, and enable real-time collaboration. The application reads in a patient's DICOM files (CTs, MRIs, US) then reconstructs the scanned organ in an interactive 3D model. This gives medical professionals more spatial information on the organ as well as a higher detail when viewing the organ in 3D versus referring to 2D images.",

With great experience as a mobile application developer and researcher with a strong passion for Engineering, whether it be software or hardware. Moreover, I also have a strong background in cross domain fields of health, as well as retail management. During the program, I experienced three co-op terms working as a mobile application developer, designing and developing an iOS application for the iPad that utilizes computer vision to detect distinct products from store shelves. Along with my work experience, the final year focused on my Undergraduate Thesis which was developing an augmented reality visualization system of polycystic kidney disease for preoperative planning.\nData Engineering has been a passion of mine and excites me as it allows me to explore data that can be used to benefit society. Data engineering also solves some of the most complex problems, which I am enthusiastic about being a part of."
