# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: "I am a recent graduate receiving my Honours Bachelor of Computer Science (B.CS.) in 2019 from Sheridan College. With great experience as a mobile application developer and researcher with a strong passion for Engineering, whether it be software or hardware. Moreover, I also have a strong background in cross domain fields of health, as well as retail management. During the program, I experienced three co-op terms working as a mobile application developer, designing and developing an iOS application for the iPad that utilizes computer vision to detect distinct products from store shelves. Along with my work experience, the final year focused on my Undergraduate Thesis which was developing an augmented reality visualization system of polycystic kidney disease for preoperative planning.

Data Engineering has been a passion of mine and excites me as it allows me to explore data that can be used to benefit society. Data engineering also solves some of the most complex problems, which I am enthusiastic about being a part of."

    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Developed a Cluster Monitoring Agent that allows users to monitor nodes in a cluster by storing each nodes' hardware specifications, as well as resource usages and store into a RDBMS Database in realtime. This project contains many bash scripts to automate the creation of SQL databases, generate tables, create, start, stop Docker, and run PostgreSQL queries.
  - name: "Core Java Apps"
    git_url: "/core_java"
    description: 

      - "Developed three Java applications, all three applications implement Maven for build automation, as well as JUnit and Mockito for testing. The three applications built are:"

      - "Twitter App: an application to explore REST API by interacting with Twitter's API using HTTP GET and POST requests and responses to perform CRD (create, read, delete) actions on tweets."

      - "JDBC App: a Java Database Connectivity application that connects to a PostgreSQL database using the Java-based data access technology. Following the DAO pattern, the user can do CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations."

      - "Grep App: replicates the recursive grep tool in a Linux based system. The grep application searches recursively in a given directory for a specified text pattern and outputs it to the user. This application uses Java I/O, regex, and stream APIs."
  - name: "Springboot App"
    git_url: "/springboot"
    description: "Created an online trading simulation application. The project uses REST API to allow users to create and manage their trader account while using it to make orders and trades on the market. This application is a microservice which is implemented with Springboot for dependency injection. The application stores trader accounts, quotes, orders onto a PSQL database. The IEX Market Data are stored on and used from IEX Cloud's API."

      - "Undergraduate Thesis: Designed and developed a HoloLens augmented reality application (C#) that allows medical professionals to better plan surgical procedures, and enable real-time collaboration. The application reads in a patient's DICOM files (CTs, MRIs, US) then reconstructs the scanned organ in an interactive 3D model. This gives medical professionals more spatial information on the organ as well as a higher detail when viewing the organ in 3D versus referring to 2D images."
